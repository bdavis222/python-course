Welcome! This is an interactive course designed to teach Python programming to beginners with no programming experience. The course contains three main sections:

#### Lessons

These are the main lessons that will teach the concepts. These are located in the `Lessons` folder, and are numbered according to the order in which each lesson should be taken.

#### Tutorials

After each lesson, the student can find a corresponding tutorial in the `Tutorials` folder. The `Solutions` folder within the `Tutorials` folder has solutions for all of the tutorials. Obviously, these should only be viewed for each tutorial _after_ completing that tutorial.

#### Projects

The projects are located in the `Projects` folder, and should only be attempted _after_ all of the lessons and tutorials are completed.

## How to begin the course

Hold down the control key (or the command key on Mac) while clicking [here](https://bdavis222.github.io/python-course) to visit the website for the course in a new tab. (You may want to keep both tabs open so you can come back to these instructions while beginning the course in this new tab.)

When the course website is launched in the new tab you just opened, you will see the following:

Note that the three folders shown in the red box are the only things you need to access to begin the course. Double-click the `Lessons` folder and then double-click `00_intro.ipynb` to begin the first lesson. The lesson content will be displayed on the right side of the screen.

At any time, you can navigate back to the starting folder by clicking the folder icon shown in this image:
