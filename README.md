# Introduction to Python

Welcome! This is an interactive course designed to teach Python programming to beginners with no programming experience. The course contains three main sections:

## Lessons

These are the main lessons that will teach the concepts. These are located in the `Lessons` folder, and are numbered according to the order in which each lesson should be taken.

## Tutorials

After each lesson, the student can find a corresponding tutorial in the `Tutorials` folder. The `solutions` folder within the `Tutorials` folder has solutions for all of the tutorials. Obviously, these should only be viewed for each tutorial _after_ completing that tutorial.

## Projects

The projects are located in the `Projects` folder, and should only be attempted _after_ all of the lessons and tutorials are completed.
