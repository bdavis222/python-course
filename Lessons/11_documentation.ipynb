    "One of the most essential skills any programmer possesses is the ability to read through documentation of existing code and understand how to use it. For example, look at the documentation page for the `enumerate` function: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate\n",

Doing so gives a few results, but the official Python documentation (the one at http://docs.python.org) might not be at the top. We should do this anytime we want to better understand any of the code we are using.\n",
