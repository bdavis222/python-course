    "In our last lesson, we learned that classes are good for packing data (attributes) and functionality (methods) together for a specific class of objects. Sometimes, there are classes of objects that are also _subclasses_ of other objects. This means they may have something specific that's different from their parent class, but are also very similar, and will reuse certain attributes or methods from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
