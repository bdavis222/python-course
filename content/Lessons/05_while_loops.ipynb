    "The basic syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "while <condition>:\n",
    "    <code>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reserved word \"while\" is used, followed by a true/false condition and a colon, and then **the code indented below that is run while that condition remains true.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a while-loop with a condition of \"5 is greater than 2\" would look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "while 5 > 2:\n",
    "    <code>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note that 5 will _always_ be greater than 2, so the indented code will run infinitely! Don't do this!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you accidentally cause an infinite loop like this, make sure to press the stop button (to the right of the Run button) at the top of the screen, followed by the restart button. Then you can fix your code and re-run it."
